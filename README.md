#Onboard

A Minecraft Bukkit plugin for new player onboarding

* Welcomes and displays configurable rules to new players (belonging to a specific LuckPerms group) through vanilla titles/subtitles
* Prompts the player to accept the rules by typing `/accept`
* Displays configurable join messages, moves the player to a post-onboarding LuckPerms group and randomly teleports the player to a location within a specified range
